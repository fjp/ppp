## Terms

### affordability

One of the ideals (correcteness, reliability, well designed, affordable, maintainable) a programmer should aim for when creating a program. 

### analysis 

One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) to develop a program. What’s the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need? 

### blackboard 

We learn from experience and modify our behavior based on what we learn. That’s essential for effective software development. 
For any large project, we don’t know everything there is to know about the problem and its solution before we start. We can try out ideas and get feedback by programming, 
but in the earlier stages of development it is easier (and faster) to get feedback by writing down design ideas, trying out those design ideas, and using scenarios on friends. 
The best design tool we know of is a blackboard (use a whiteboard instead if you prefer chemical smells over chalk dust). Never design alone if you can avoid it! 
Don’t start coding before you have tried out your ideas by explaining them to someone. Discuss designs and programming techniques with friends, colleagues, potential users, 
and so on before you head for the keyboard. It is amazing how much you can learn from simply trying to articulate an idea. 
After all, a program is nothing more than an expression (in code) of some ideas.

### CAD/CAM

computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture is the use of software to control machine tools and related ones in the manufacturing of workpieces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing).
### communication 

(from Latin communicare, meaning "to share")[1] is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication). It is important for a programmer to intreact with other people to develop high quality software. 

### correctness 

In theoretical computer science, correctness of an algorithm is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is correct with respect to a specification. 
Functional correctness refers to the input-output behavior of the algorithm (i.e., for each input it produces the expected output). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science))

### customer 

For example someone who buys a piece of software or hardware that runs software.

### design 

Software programs are designed using best practices such as design patterns. One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall struc- ture of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?
### feedback 

some sort of information that can be used to act upon. Feedback is achieved through testing a piece of software. Another application in control theory is to use the output as feedback to compare it against the desired output. 

### GUI 

Graphical User Interface are used to interact with the user. Frameworks help you to develop GUIs, such as Qt. 

### ideals 

Goals a programmer should strive for when developing a program. We want correctness and as part of that, reliability. If the program doesn’t do what it is supposed to do, and do so in a way so that we can rely on it, it is at best a serious nuisance, at worst a danger. We want it to be well designed so that it addresses a real need well; it doesn’t really matter that a program is correct if what it does is irrelevant to us or if it correctly does something in a way that annoys us. 
We also want it to be affordable; our code must be maintainable; that is, its struc- ture must be such that someone who didn’t write it can understand it and make changes. 
A successful program “lives” for a long time (often for decades) and will be changed again and again.

### implementation 

Programming plus testing is often called implementation. Obviously, this simple split of software development into four parts is a simplification. 
Thick books have been written on each of these four topics and more books still about how they relate to each other. One important thing to note is that these stages of development are not independent and do not occur strictly in sequence. 
We typically start with analysis, but feedback from testing can help improve the programming; problems with getting the program working may indicate a problem with the design; and working with the design may suggest aspects of the problem that hitherto had been overlooked in the analysis. Actually using the system typically exposes weaknesses of the analysis. 

### programmer 

someone who develops programs; programmers, (program) designers, testers, animators, focus group managers, experimental psychologists, user interface designers, analysts, system administrators, 
customer relations people, sound engineers, project managers, quality engineers, statisticians, hardware interface engineers, requirements engineers, safety officers, mathematicians, sales support personnel, troubleshooters, network designers, methodologists, software tools managers, software librarians, etc. 

### programming 

One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. 
Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Make sure that the code is correct and maintainable. 


### software 

Runs on hardware to solve a specific problem or provide a service. Software is programming using a programming languauge and translated into machine code to be executed on a hardware. Good software is invisible. You can’t see it, feel it, weigh it, or knock on it. Software is a collection of programs running on some computer. Sometimes, we can see the computer. Often, we can see only something that contains the computer, such as a telephone, a camera, a bread maker, a car, or a wind turbine. We can see what that software does. We can be annoyed or hurt if it doesn’t do what it is supposed to do. We can be annoyed or hurt if what it is supposed to do doesn’t suit our needs.

### stereotype 

In social psychology, a stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular category of people. 
Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category. 
While such generalizations may be useful when making quick decisions, they may be erroneous when applied to particular individuals. Stereotypes encourage prejudice and may arise for a number of reasons. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype)

### testing 

One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out. 
Testing with unit tests that compare the output result of a program to an expected result.

### user 

Someone who uses for example a system or a piece of software or hardware that runs software on it.
