### assignment

An assignment is an operator, denoted by the `=` sign. This operator assings a new value (literal) to a variable. 
For example:

```
int a = 3; // a starts out with the value 3

a = 4; // a gets the value 4 (“becomes 4”)

int b = a; // b starts out with a copy of a’s value (that is, 4)

b = a+5; // b gets the value a+5 (that is, 9) a:

a = a+7; // a gets the value a+7 (that is, 11)
```

That last assignment deserves notice. First of all it clearly shows that `=` does not mean equals — clearly, 
a doesn’t equal `a+7`. It means assignment, that is, to place a new value in a variable. 
What is done for `a=a+7` is the following:

1. First, get the value of `a`; that’s the integer `4`. 
2. Next, add `7` to that `4`, yielding the integer `11`. 
3. Finally, put that `11` into `a`.
