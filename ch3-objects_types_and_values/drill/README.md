## Drill


1. This drill is to write a program that produces a simple form letter based on user input. 
Begin by typing the code from §3.1 prompting a user to enter his or her first name and writing “Hello, first_name” where first_name is the name entered by the user. 
Then modify your code as follows: change the prompt to “Enter the name of the person you want to write to” and change the output to “Dear first_name,”. Don’t forget the comma.
