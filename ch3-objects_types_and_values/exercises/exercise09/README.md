### Exercise 09

Write a program that converts spelled-out numbers such as “zero” and “two” into digits, such as 0 and 2. 
When the user inputs a number, the program should print out the corresponding digit. 
Do it for the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and write out `not a number I know` if the user enters something 
that doesn’t correspond, such as `stupid computer!`.
