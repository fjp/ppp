# Chapter 2 - Terms

// - Double forward slashes are used for comments. Comments are meant to explain the source code to other programmers and yourself after a long not reading it for a long time.
<< - Left shift operator is used to shift bits and to output string literals and characters using cout.
C++ - Is a programming language
comment - Used to explain the source code to other programmers and yourself after not reading it for a long time.  
compiler - A program that checks the syntax of a source code and translates it to object code.
compile-time - The time the compiler is analyzing the source code and translating it to object code. At this state compile-time errors are captured. 
error - Errors can be categorized into compile-time (missing include or syntax errors such wrong spelling of standard types or missing semicolons), link-time errors (used declarations but without finding the definitions) and runtime or logical-errors (accessing null pointers or memory addresses that was already deleted, stack variables passed as references).  
cout - Function in the standard iostream header to write strings and characters to the standard output stream.
executable - A program or an application that is the final result of compiling source files to object files and linking them to an executable that can be executed. 
function - A piece of source code that encapsulates statements inside curyly braces that are executed in order. A function can have a parameter list and has a return type which can be void. 
header - A file that contains souce code declarations and definitions which is usally included using an #include directive.
IDE - Inegrated or Interactive Development Envornment is a tool with helpful features for creating new programs. 
#include - A preprocessor directive to include a header file that can contain required definitions for example from the standard library.
library - A collection of facilities (such as functions or classes) that can be reused and make it easier to create new applications. 
linker - One program in the build process that links one ore more object files together to create an executable.
main() - The main entry point of every C++ program. It returns an integer denoting the success of the program and can have command line arguments as its input parameters.
object code - A file with ending .obj on Windows and .o on Linux which contains object code. Is created invoking the compiler on a source code file (.h or .cpp).
output - For example the text a program outpus using cout.
program - An executable program or application that is the result of compiling source codes files to object files and linking them to an executable program. 
source code - Instructions of a program that are written in a text editor inside a header (.h) or source code file (.cpp).
statement - A line of source code that is terminated by a semicolon inside a block of curly braces for example of a function.
