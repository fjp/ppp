### Estimation

Our hexagon was regular with 2cm sides. 
Did we get that answer right? Just do the "back of the envelope" calculation. 
Take a piece a paper and scribble on it. Don't feel that's beneath you. 
Many famous scientists have been greatly admired for their ability to come
up with an approximate answer using a pencil and the back of an envelope (or a napkin). 
This is an ability — a simple habit, really — that can save us a lot of time and confusion.


In a regular hexagon the side lengths are the same as the radius of a circle that goes through each of the six corners.
