### Exercise 05

Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. 
Your calculator should be able to handle the four basic math operations — 
add, subtract, multiply, and divide — on two input values. 
Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: two `double` values and a character to represent an operation. 
If the entry arguments are `35.6`, `24.1`, and `'+'`, the program output should be `The sum of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7`. 
In Chapter 6 we look at a much more sophisticated simple calculator.
