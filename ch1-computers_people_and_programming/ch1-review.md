1. What is software?

Sofware runs on hardware and is a collection of code instructions that are intended to solve a problem.
For example to develop a self driving car it requires computers with running software programs that process sensor data and output actuator commands.
This is achieved through algorithms programmed in software programs which are executed on the hardware.

2. Why is software important?

It helps to solve a variety of real world problems.
Software is used by people every day which makes their hardware devices useful.
It is the software that enables us to talk over the phone or write emails on our computers and send them via servers that run themselfes software to route the packages.

Software is important to help develop products that make our lifes easier in the best case.

3. Where is software important?

Software is important in the design and construction of machines. The produced machines run themselfes software which controls them. 
Software programs are programmed to process data and find useful information in this data. Software is important for monitoring, such as the heart rate of a human.

4. What could go wrong if some software fails? List some examples. 

Errors in software can injure people or lead to death. Other errors are costly due to damaged or lost hardware such as mars rovers. 
For example a failure in the flight control system of airplanes flying towards each other can cause a crash.
Failures in the software of monitoring devices or implanted heart rate devices can lead to peoples death.

If a bug leads to a server outage that might be used by many people can lead to a financial loss.

5. Where does software play an important role? List some examples. 

Software is important in all kinds of fields: 

- Medicine
- Transportation
- Communication
- Finance
- ...

6. What are some jobs related to software development? List some.

- Software Developer
- Software Architecture Designer
- Tester
- Data Scientist

These are jobs commonly heard of but with a broad meaning. Software is realted to all kinds of jobs and used in many industries.
Banking industry, doctors use it to analyze patient data and logistic companys to plan their routs.

7. What’s the difference between computer science and programming? 

Computer since is a study or science that describes theories such as program algorithms and data structures. 
Programming is a tool; it is a fundamental tool for expressing solutions to fundamental and practical problems so that they can be tested, 
improved through experiment, and used. Programming is where ideas and theories meet reality. 
This is where computer science can become an experimental discipline, rather than pure theory, and impact the world. 
In this context, as in many others, it is essential that programming is an expression of well-tried practices as well as the theories.

10. What kinds of queries do you ask online? List some.

11. What are some uses of software in science? List some.



12. What are some uses of software in medicine? List some.



13. What are some uses of software in entertainment? List some. 



14. What general properties do we expect from good software? 



15. What does a software developer look like?


16. What are the stages of software development?

We can describe the process of developing a program as having four stages:
1. Analysis: What’s the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need?
2. Design: How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall structure of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?
3. Programming: Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Make sure that the code is correct and maintainable.
4. Testing: Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out.

Programming plus testing is often called implementation.



17. Why can software development be difficult? List some reasons. 

Programming itself is more or less simple. The difficult part about software development is problem solving. 
Solving difficult problems requires the steps described in the prvious question. In the analysis of the problem things can go wrong such as misunderstanding of what the user exactly wants.
Designing a program can be difficult because of a chosen design that works for simple tasks but has to be adapted to work more generically. 
Bugs that are introduced while programming are sometimes difficult to spot and can lead to unfulfilled constraints (time, space, money, reliability, etc.). 
A software program that is not tested will be difficult to debug if it consists of a large code base. Other difficulties with testing are forgotten tests that would've solved a unseen bug.
Writing useful tests is difficult and takes time to master.
