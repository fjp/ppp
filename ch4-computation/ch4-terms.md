### abstraction

Our main tool for organizing a program — and for organizing our thoughts as we program — 
is to break up a big computation into many little ones. This technique comes in two variations:

- *Abstraction:* Hide details that we don’t need to use a facility ("implementation details") 
behind a convenient and general interface. For example, rather than considering the details of how to sort a phone book 
(thick books have been written about how to sort), we just call the sort algorithm from the C++ standard library.
`sort()` is a variant (§21.9) of the standard library sort algorithm (§21.8, §B.5.4) defined in `std_library.h`. 
Another example is the way we use computer memory. Direct use of memory can be quite messy,
so we access it through typed and named variables (§3.2), standard library `vectors` (§4.6, Chapters 17–19), `maps` (Chapter 21), etc.

- *"Divide and conquer":* Here we take a large problem and divide it into several little ones. 
For example, if we need to build a dictionary, we can separate that job into three: read the data, sort the data, and output the data.
