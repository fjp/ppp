### Exercise 09

Try to calculate the number of rice grains that the inventor asked for in exercise 8 above. 
You'll find that the number is so large that it won't fit in an `int` or a `double`. 
Observe what happens when the number gets too large to represent exactly as an `int` and as a `double`. 
What is the largest number of squares for which you can calculate the exact number of grains (using an `int`)? 
What is the largest number of squares for which you can calculate the approximate number of grains (using a `double`)?
