### Square

Implement `square()` without using the multiplication operator; 
that is, do the `x*x` by repeated addition (start a variable result at `0` and add `x` to it `x` times). 
Then run some version of “the first program” using that `square()`.


.. literalinclude:: ../ch4-computation/trythis/05-square/main.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :caption: square.cpp
   :linenos:


The output of the program of the first few lines is:

```
0	0
1	1
2	4
3	9
4	16
5	25
6	36
7	49
8	64
9	81
...
```
