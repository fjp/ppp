### Exercise 18

Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form

```
ax2 + bx + c = 0
```

If you don't know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. 
Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. 
Use `double`s for the user inputs for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, 
output both `x1` and `x2`.
