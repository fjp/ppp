# Chapter 1 - Computers, People, and Programming - Review Questions

1. What is software?

Sofware runs on hardware and is a collection of code instructions that are intended to solve a problem.
For example to develop a self driving car it requires computers with running software programs that process sensor data and output actuator commands.
This is achieved through algorithms programmed in software programs which are executed on the hardware.

2. Why is software important?

It helps to solve a variety of real world problems.
Software is used by people every day which makes their hardware devices useful.
It is the software that enables us to talk over the phone or write emails on our computers and send them via servers that run themselfes software to route the packages.

Software is important to help develop products that make our lifes easier in the best case.

3. Where is software important?

Software is important in the design and construction of machines. The produced machines run themselfes software which controls them. 
Software programs are programmed to process data and find useful information in this data. Software is important for monitoring, such as the heart rate of a human.


4. What could go wrong if some software fails? List some examples. 

Errors in software can injure people or lead to death. Other errors are costly due to damaged or lost hardware such as mars rovers. 
For example a failure in the flight control system of airplanes flying towards each other can cause a crash.
Failures in the software of monitoring devices or implanted heart rate devices can lead to peoples death.

If a bug leads to a server outage that might be used by many people can lead to a financial loss.

5. Where does software play an important role? List some examples. 

 Most computers work out of our sight and are part of the systems that keep our civilization going. Some fill rooms; others are smaller than a small coin. Many of the most interesting computers don’t directly interact with a human through a keyboard, mouse, or similar gadget.

Software is important in all kinds of fields: 

- Medicine
- Transportation
- Communication
- Finance
- ...

6. What are some jobs related to software development? List some.

- Software Developer
- Software Architecture Designer
- Tester
- Data Scientist

These are jobs commonly heard of but with a broad meaning. Software is realted to all kinds of jobs and used in many industries.
Banking industry, doctors use it to analyze patient data and logistic companys to plan their routs.

Programmers, (program) designers, testers, animators, focus group managers, experimental psychologists, user interface designers, analysts, system administrators, 
customer relations people, sound engineers, project managers, quality engineers, statisticians, hardware interface engineers, requirements engineers, safety officers, 
mathematicians, sales support personnel, troubleshooters, network designers, methodologists, software tools managers, software librarians, etc.

7. What’s the difference between computer science and programming? 

Programming is one of the fundamental topics that underlie everything in computer-related fields, and it has a natural place in a balanced course of computer science.

Computer since is a study or science that describes theories such as program algorithms and data structures. 
Programming is a tool; it is a fundamental tool for expressing solutions to fundamental and practical problems so that they can be tested, 
improved through experiment, and used. Programming is where ideas and theories meet reality. 
This is where computer science can become an experimental discipline, rather than pure theory, and impact the world. 
In this context, as in many others, it is essential that programming is an expression of well-tried practices as well as the theories.

A 1995 U.S. government “blue book” defines computer science like this: “The systematic study of computing systems and computation. 
The body of knowledge resulting from this discipline contains theories for understanding computing systems and methods; design methodology, algorithms, and tools; 
methods for the testing of concepts; methods of analysis and verification; and knowledge representation and implementation.”

Wikipedia defines it as: “Computer science, or computing science, is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computa- tion and their implementation and application in computer systems. 
Computer science has many sub-fields; some emphasize the computation of specific results (such as computer graphics), while others (such as computational complexity theory) relate to properties of computational problems. 
Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, programming language theory studies approaches to describing computations, while computer programming applies specific programming languages to solve specific computational problems.”

8. Where in the design, construction, and use of a ship is software used? 

- Design: A ship or engine is desigined with the help of computer software creating, architectural and engineering drawings, general calculations, visualization of spaces and parts, and simulations of the performance of parts.
- Construction: A modern shipyard is heavily computerized. The assembly of a ship is carefully planned using computers, and the work is guided by computers. 
Welding is done by robots. In particular, a modern double-hulled tanker couldn’t be built without little welding robots to do the welding from within the space between the hulls. 
There just isn’t room for a human in there. Cutting steel plates for a ship was one of the world’s first CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture) applications.
- The engine: The engine has electronic fuel injection and is controlled by a few dozen computers. For a 100,000-horsepower engine, that’s a nontrivial task. 
For example, the engine management computers continuously adjust fuel mix to minimize the pollution that would result from a badly tuned engine. 
Many of the pumps associated with the engine (and other parts of the ship) are themselves computerized.
- Management: Ships sail where there is cargo to pick up and to deliver. 
The scheduling of fleets of ships is a continuing process (computerized, of course) so that routings change with the weather, with supply and demand, and with space and loading capacity of harbors. 
There are even websites where you can watch the position of major merchant vessels at any time. 
- Monitoring: An oceangoing ship is largely autonomous; that is, its crew can handle most contingencies likely to arise before the next port. However, they are also part of a globe-spanning network. The crew has access to reasonably accurate weather information (from and through — comput- erized — satellites). They have a GPS (global positioning system) and computer-controlled and computer-enhanced radar. If the crew needs a rest, most systems (including the engine, radar, etc.) can be monitored (via satellite) from a shipping-line control room. If anything unusual is spotted, or if the connection “back home” is broken, the crew is notified.

9. What is a server farm?

A “server farm” is a collection of computers providing web services.
Every major company runs programs on the web to interact with its users/customers. 
Examples are Amazon (book and other sales), and eBay (online auctions). Millions of companies, organizations, and individuals also have a presence on the web, which is hosted in a server farm.
Google uses its erver farm to provide people with answers to their search queries. 
This kind of computer use is often referred to as information processing. It focuses on data — often lots of data. 

10. What kinds of queries do you ask online? List some.

- C++ programming questions, such as C++11 features.
- Weather queris for my current location.
- Home automation and robotics questions that interest me.
- News queries
- ...

11. What are some uses of software in science? List some.

Finally, research — science itself — relies heavily on computers. The telescopes that probe the secrets of distant stars could not be designed, built, 
or operated without computers, and the masses of data they produce couldn’t be analyzed and understood without computers. 
An individual biology field researcher may not be heavily computerized (unless, of course, a camera, a digital tape recorder, a telephone, etc. are used), 
but back in the lab, the data has to be stored, analyzed, checked against computer models, and communicated to fellow scientists. 
Modern chemistry and biology — including medical research — use computers to an extent undreamed of a few years ago and still unimagined by most people. 
The human genome was sequenced by computers. Or — let’s be precise — the human genome was sequenced by humans using computers. 
In all of these examples, we see computers as something that enables us to do something we would have had a harder time doing without computers.

12. What are some uses of software in medicine? List some.

CAT (computed axial tomography) scanner and operating theater for computer-aided surgery (also called “robot-assisted surgery” or “robotic surgery”).
The scanners basi- cally are computers; the pulses they send out are controlled by a computer, and the readings of the relevant body part are converted to (three-dimensional) images by quite sophisticated algorithms.
For computer-aided surgery a wide variety of imaging techniques are used to let the surgeon see the inside of the patient. 
With the aid of a computer a surgeon can use tools that are too fine for a human hand to hold or in a place where a human hand could not reach without unnecessary cutting.
The computer can also help steady the surgeon’s “hand” to allow for more delicate work than would otherwise be possible. Finally, a “robotic” system can be operated remotely, thus making it possible for a doctor to help someone remotely (over the internet).

Instant access to patient records. Knowing the medical history of a patient (earlier illnesses, medicines tried earlier, allergies, hereditary problems, general health, current medication, etc.) 
simplifies the problem of diagnosis and minimizes the chance of mistakes.

13. What are some uses of software in entertainment? List some. 

Hollywood and Pixar use software for 3D animations. MP3 players and phones are small computers that run software that can be used to play music and watch videos.


14. What general properties do we expect from good software? 

What do we want from our programs? What do we want in general, as opposed to a particular feature of a particular program? We want **correctness** and as part of that, **reliability**. 
If the program doesn’t do what it is supposed to do, and do so in a way so that we can rely on it, it is at best a serious nuisance, at worst a danger. 
We want it to be **well designed** so that it addresses a real need well. We also want it to be **affordablei**.
Our code must be maintainable; that is, its structure must be such that someone who didn’t write it can understand it and make changes. 
A successful program “lives” for a long time (often for decades) and will be changed again and again. 
For example, it will be moved to new hardware, it will have new features added, it will be modified to use new I/O facilities (screens, video, sound), to interact using new natural languages, etc. 
Only a failed program will never be modified. To be maintainable, a program must be simple relative to its requirements, and the code must directly represent the ideas expressed.


15. What does a software developer look like?

Hollywood and similar “popular culture” sources of disinformation have assigned largely negative images to programmers.
For example, we have all seen the solitary, fat, ugly nerd with no social skills who is obsessed with video games and breaking into other people’s computers.

There creation of a successful piece of software, computerized gadget, or system involves dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people performing a bewildering set of roles: 
for example, programmers, (program) designers, testers, animators, focus group managers, experimental psychologists, user interface designers, analysts, system administrators, 
customer relations people, sound engineers, project managers, quality engineers, statisticians, hardware interface engineers, requirements engineers, safety officers, mathematicians, 
sales support personnel, troubleshooters, network designers, methodologists, software tools managers, software librarians, etc. 
The range of roles is huge and made even more bewildering by the titles varying from organization to organization: 
one organization’s “engineer” may be another organization’s “programmer” and yet another organization’s “developer,” “member of technical staff,” or “architect.”

The myth of a programmer being isolated is just that: a myth. People who like to work on their own choose areas of work where that is most feasible and usually complain bitterly about the number of “interruptions” and meetings. 
People who prefer to interact with other people have an easier time because modern software development is a team activity. The implication is that social and communication skills are essential and valued far more than the stereotypes indicate. 
On a short list of highly desirable skills for a programmer (however you realistically define programmer), you find the ability to communicate well — with people from a wide variety of backgrounds — informally, in meetings, in writing, and in formal presentations.

16. What are the stages of software development?

We can describe the process of developing a program as having four stages:
1. Analysis: What’s the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need?
2. Design: How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall structure of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?
3. Programming: Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Make sure that the code is correct and maintainable.
4. Testing: Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out.

Programming plus testing is often called implementation.

17. Why can software development be difficult? List some reasons. 

Programming itself is more or less simple. The difficult part about software development is problem solving. 
Solving difficult problems requires the steps described in the prvious question. In the analysis of the problem things can go wrong such as misunderstanding of what the user exactly wants.
Designing a program can be difficult because of a chosen design that works for simple tasks but has to be adapted to work more generically. 
Bugs that are introduced while programming are sometimes difficult to spot and can lead to unfulfilled constraints (time, space, money, reliability, etc.). 
A software program that is not tested will be difficult to debug if it consists of a large code base. Other difficulties with testing are forgotten tests that would've solved a unseen bug.
Writing useful tests is difficult and takes time to master. 

“Programming is understanding”: when you can program a task, you understand it. Conversely, when you under- stand a task thoroughly, you can write a program to do it. 
In other words, we can see programming as part of an effort to thoroughly understand a topic. A program is a precise representation of our understanding of a topic.

Information processing, such as providing answers to (Google) search queries, leads to challenges in the organization and transmission of data and 
lots of interesting work on how to present vast amounts of data in a comprehensible form: “user interface” is a very important aspect of handling data.

18. What are some uses of software that make your life easier?

Our civilization runs on software. Improving software and finding new uses for software are two of the ways an individual can help improve the lives of many. Programming plays an essential role in that.
There are multiple computers that run software in my car which help me find my goal, stay in the lane when I press the gas pedal too much or brake too hard.
Google's servers provide me with the answers I search for and guide me to the web server that has the information I requested.
My phone helps me to stay connected with my girlfriend, family and friends.
