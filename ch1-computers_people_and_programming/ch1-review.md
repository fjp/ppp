1. What is software?

Sofware runs on hardware and is a collection of code instructions that should solve a problem.
For example to develop a self driving car it requires computers that process sensor data and output actuator commands.
This is achieved through algorithms programmed in software programs.

2. Why is software important?

It helps to solve a variety of real world problems.
Software is used by people every day which makes their hardware devices useful.

7. Whatâ€™s the difference between computer science and programming? 

Programming is a tool; it is a fundamental tool for expressing solutions to fundamental and practical problems so that they can be tested, 
improved through experiment, and used. Programming is where ideas and theories meet reality. 
This is where computer science can become an experimental discipline, rather than pure theory, and impact the world. 
In this context, as in many others, it is essential that programming is an expression of well-tried practices as well as the theories.
