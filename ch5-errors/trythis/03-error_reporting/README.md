### Error Reporting

Test this program with a variety of values. Print out the values of `area1`, `area2`,
`area3`, and `ratio`. Insert more tests until all errors are caught. How do you know that
you caught all errors? This is not a trick question; in this particular example you can
give a valid argument for having caught all errors.
