### Exercise 03

Write a description of how to get from the front door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, 
to the door of your classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are not, pick another target). 
Have a friend try to follow the instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes along. 
To keep friends, it may be a good idea to “field test” those instructions before giving them to a friend.
