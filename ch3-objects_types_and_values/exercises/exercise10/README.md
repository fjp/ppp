### Exercise 10

Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:

```
+ 100 3.14 
* 4 5
```

Read the operation into a string called `operation` and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, 
for example, `if (operation=="+")`. Read the operands into variables of type `double`. 
Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
