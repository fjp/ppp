- affordability -  
- analysis - One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) to develop a program. What’s the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need? 
- blackboard - We learn from experience and modify our behavior based on what we learn. That’s essential for effective software development. 
For any large project, we don’t know everything there is to know about the problem and its solution before we start. We can try out ideas and get feedback by programming, 
but in the earlier stages of development it is easier (and faster) to get feedback by writing down design ideas, trying out those design ideas, and using scenarios on friends. 
The best design tool we know of is a blackboard (use a whiteboard instead if you prefer chemical smells over chalk dust). Never design alone if you can avoid it! 
Don’t start coding before you have tried out your ideas by explaining them to someone. Discuss designs and programming techniques with friends, colleagues, potential users, 
and so on before you head for the keyboard. It is amazing how much you can learn from simply trying to articulate an idea. 
After all, a program is nothing more than an expression (in code) of some ideas.
- CAD/CAM - computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture is the use of software to control machine tools and related ones in the manufacturing of workpieces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing).
- communication - (from Latin communicare, meaning "to share")[1] is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication). It is important for a programmer to intreact with other people to develop high quality software. 
- correctness - In theoretical computer science, correctness of an algorithm is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is correct with respect to a specification. 
Functional correctness refers to the input-output behavior of the algorithm (i.e., for each input it produces the expected output). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science))
- customer - For example someone who buys a piece of software or hardware that runs software.
- design - Software programs are designed using best practices such as design patterns. One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall struc- ture of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?
- feedback - some sort of information that can be used to act upon. Feedback is achieved through testing a piece of software. Another application in control theory is to use the output as feedback to compare it against the desired output. 
- GUI - Graphical User Interface are used to interact with the user. Frameworks help you to develop GUIs, such as Qt. 
- ideals 
- implementation
- programmer - programmers, (program) designers, testers, animators, focus group managers, experimental psychologists, user interface designers, analysts, system administrators, 
customer relations people, sound engineers, project managers, quality engineers, statisticians, hardware interface engineers, requirements engineers, safety officers, mathematicians, sales support personnel, troubleshooters, network designers, methodologists, software tools managers, software librarians, etc. 
- programming - ONe of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. 
Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Make sure that the code is correct and maintainable. 
- software - 
- stereotype - 
- testing - One of the four stages (analysis, design, programming, testing) of developing a program. Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out. 
Testing with unit tests that compare the output result of a program to an expected result.
