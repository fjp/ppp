### Exercise 06

Write a program that prompts the user to enter three integer values, and then outputs the values in numerical sequence separated by commas. 
So, if the user enters the values 10 4 6, the output should be 4, 6, 10. 
If two values are the same, they should just be ordered together. So, the input 4 5 4 should give 4, 4, 5.
