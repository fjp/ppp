### Character Loop

The character `'b'` is `char('a'+1)`, `'c'` is `char('a'+2)`, etc. 
Use a loop to write out a table of characters with their corresponding integer values:

.. literalinclude:: ../ch4-computation/trythis/03-character_loop/main.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :caption: CharacterLoop.cpp
   :linenos:

.
