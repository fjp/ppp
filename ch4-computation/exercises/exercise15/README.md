### Exercise 15

Write a program that takes an input value `n` and then finds the first `n` primes.

.. literalinclude:: ../ch4-computation/exercises/exercise15/main.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :caption: primes_input.cpp
   :linenos:


The output for `10` is :

```
Enter an integer greater than 1 that defines the number of primes from 1 to n that are searched.
10
Found 10 prime numbers between 1 and 29: 
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 
```
