1. Pick an activity you do most days (such as going to class, eating dinner, or watching television). Make a list of ways computers are directly or indirectly involved.

The activity going to work involves computers in the form of traffic lights that are controlled by computers. My bike and car (depending which vehicle I choose to go to work) were designed using computers and my car contains multiple electronic control units. Before I leave the house I check the weather with my phone which involves not only my smartphone but computers that were used to determin the weather forecast. At work I enter the building using a chip card reader which uses cryptographie.   

2. Pick a profession, preferably one that you have some interest in or some knowledge of. Make a list of activities done by people in that profession that involve computers.

I picked software development for autonomous vehicles. 
- Developing algorithms such as trajectory planning. 
- Calibrating sensors.
- Modifying controller parameters.
- Simulating the behavior before testing it on a test vehicle.
- Testing on a test vehicle involves mutliple computers which are located not only in the vehicle.
- Communicating with gps sattelites to locate the vehicle on the street. 

3. Swap your list from exercise 2 with a friend who picked a different profession and improve his or her list. When you have both done that, compare your results. Remember: There is no perfect solution to an open-ended exercise; improvements are always possible.

4. From your own experience, describe an activity that would not have been possible without computers.

- Letting a car drive on its own and sitting behind the steering wheel without intervention is an activity that would not be possible without computers. 
- Measuring my heart rate while running wit my smart watch is another example.

5. Make a list of programs (software applications) that you have directly used. List only examples where you obviously interact with a program (such as when selecting a new song on an MP3 player) and not cases where there just might happen to be a computer involved (such as turning
the steering wheel of your car).

- Google Chrome-Webbrowser
- CLion, Visual Studio, ...
- Spotify
- Android and its Apps
- ...

6. Make a list of ten activities that people do that do not involve computers
in any way, even indirectly. This may be harder than you think!

- Walk
- Talk
- Eat without electronic devices running in the background
- Meditate
- Read a book (leaving aside the fact that it was written on a computer and printed using a printer)

7. Identify five tasks for which computers are not used today, but for which you think they will be used at some time in the future. Write a few sentences to elaborate on each one that you choose.

- Driving a car is a task that requires a human to turn the steering wheel and actuate the gas and brake pedals. Although there are efforts to automate this task and it is possible in some predefined situations, all challenges are not yet solved. 
- Diagnostic analysis can already be done by machine learning algorithms which will improve in the future when more data will become available and is processed and used more efficiently.
- Political discussions can be complex to find a solution but maybe computers could be used to identify a satisfying solution. 
- Parameter tuning for control and optimization algorithms is an art and requires knowledge in this area. An software that is aware of the parameters and their size should be developed to get the optimal parameter set. If there are multiple parameters for different situations the application should output the different parameter sets as its result. 
- Searching for knowledge one is missing in understanding something is a task that requires time and effort to find the missing information. Computers could be used to detect which information a human is lacking and guide them in finding what they are searching.

8. Write an explanation (at least 100 words, but fewer than 500) of why you
would like to be a computer programmer. If, on the other hand, you are convinced that you would not like to be a programmer, explain that. In either case, present well-thought-out, logical arguments.

I want to be a computer programmer to help society by solving problems that, when solved, will improve the lifes of people. Another reason for me to learn programming is to learn about new algorithms and keep my brain active. Implementing algorithms and solving problems by programming an application helps in understanding the limits and best use cases of algorithms. For me it is also satisfying to find a solution to a problem and interacting with the running application, thereby learning more about the problem. It is the process to improve ones solution to a problem and to share it with others so they can profit from this insight a programmed piece of software can give. Being a programmer is great, because you can understand the code others have written and see their thought process of solving challenging problems. Thereby you learn a lot and can adapt their knowledge to your own. Last but not least, I want to program to earn a living. It is payed well and will be a valuable skill in the future, although it can already be done by computers themselves. 

9. Write an explanation (at least 100 words, but fewer than 500) of what role other than programmer you’d like to play in the computer industry (independently of whether “programmer” is your first choice).

Another role I would like to participate in the computer industy is finding algorithms to solve challenging problems. Thinking about a problem to solve it does not require one to be a programmer. Instead, a blackboard can be used to work on a solution for a problem and work on the sub tasks that need to be solved. I would like to find an approaches that can evaluate different algorithms. Another problem I would like to work on is to find the "perfect" interaction aware maneuver planner or predicting the intention of other road users with a certain probability in the future. These are just examples that I currently work on but there are other roles I would like to focus on. Making knowledge easier accesible while perserving quality. Missing information needs to be found quickly and should not lead to new open questions. 

10. Do you think computers will ever develop to be conscious, thinking beings, capable of competing with humans? Write a short paragraph (at least 100 words) supporting your position.
11. List some characteristics that most successful programmers share. Then list some characteristics that programmers are popularly assumed to have.
12. Identify at least five kinds of applications for computer programs men- tioned in this chapter and pick the one that you find the most interesting and that you would most likely want to participate in someday. Write a short paragraph (at least 100 words) explaining why you chose the one
you did.
13. How much memory would it take to store (a) this page of text, (b) this
chapter, (c) all of Shakespeare’s work? Assume one byte of memory holds one character and just try to be precise to about 20%.
14. How much memory does your computer have? Main memory? Disk?
