1. What is software?

Sofware runs on hardware and is a collection of code instructions that should solve a problem.
For example to develop a self driving car it requires computers that process sensor data and output actuator commands.
This is achieved through algorithms programmed in software programs.

2. Why is software important?

It helps to solve a variety of real world problems.
Software is used by people every day which makes their hardware devices useful.
It is the software that enables us to talk over the phone or write emails via servers that run themselfes software.

Software is important to help develop products that make our lifes easier in the best case.

3. Where is software important?

Software is important in the design and construction of machines. The produced machines run software which controls them. 
It helps to process data and find useful information in the data. Software is important for monitoring such as the heart rate of a human.

4. What could go wrong if some software fails? List some examples. 

To route the airplane traffic is a challenging task where software is used. If something goes wrong people could be injured or killed.
This is just one example. Other fields such as failing monitoring devices or implanted heart rate devices lead to peoples death.

If a bug leads to a server outage that might be used by many people can lead to a financial loss.

5. Where does software play an important role? List some examples. 

Software is important in all kinds of fields: 

- Medicine
- Transportation
- Communication
- Finance
- ...

6. What are some jobs related to software development? List some.

- Software Developer
- Software Architecture Designer
- Tester
- Data Scientist

These are jobs commonly heard. However, software is realted to all kinds of jobs and used in many industries.
Banking industry, doctors use it to analyze patient data and logistic companys to plan their routs, just to name a few examples.

7. Whatâ€™s the difference between computer science and programming? 

Computer since is a study or science that describes theories such as program algorithms and data structures. 
Programming is a tool; it is a fundamental tool for expressing solutions to fundamental and practical problems so that they can be tested, 
improved through experiment, and used. Programming is where ideas and theories meet reality. 
This is where computer science can become an experimental discipline, rather than pure theory, and impact the world. 
In this context, as in many others, it is essential that programming is an expression of well-tried practices as well as the theories.
