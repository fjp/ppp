### Exercise 14

Modify the program described in the previous exercise to take an input value max and 
then find all prime numbers from `1` to `max`.

.. literalinclude:: ../ch4-computation/exercises/exercise14/main.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :caption: sieveoferatosthenes_input.cpp
   :linenos:


Output of the program for the input `50` is:

```
Enter an upper limit up to that primes are searched.
50
The prime numbers between 1 and 50 are:
