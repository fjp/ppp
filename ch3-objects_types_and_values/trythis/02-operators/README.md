### Operators

Get this little program to run. Then, modify it to read an int rather than a double. Note that sqrt() is not defined for an int so assign n to a double and take sqrt() of that. 
Also, “exercise” some other operations. Note that for ints / is integer division and % is remainder (modulo), so that 5/2 is 2 (and not 2.5 or 3) and 5%2 is 1. 
The definitions of integer *, /, and % guarantee that for two positive ints a and b we have a/b * b + a%b == a.
