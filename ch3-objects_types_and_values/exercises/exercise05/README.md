### Exercise 05

Modify the program from exercise 04 to ask the user to enter floating-point values and store them in double variables. 
Compare the outputs of the two programs for some inputs of your choice. 
Are the results the same? Should they be? Whatâ€™s the difference?

.. literalinclude:: ../ch3-objects_types_and_values/exercises/exercise05/main.cpp
   :language: cpp

This program outpus the following:

```
Enter two double values (followed by 'Enter')
2 3
smaller = 2
larger = 3
sum = 5
difference = -1
product = 6
ratio = 0.666667
```

The ratio is different between this and the program of exercise 04, because floating-point values are not truncated when using `double` instead of `int`. 

```
Enter two double values (followed by 'Enter')
3 2
smaller = 2
larger = 3
sum = 5
difference = 1
product = 6
ratio = 1.5
```

```
Enter two double values (followed by 'Enter')
3 3
smaller = 3
larger = 3
sum = 6
difference = 0
product = 9
ratio = 1
```
