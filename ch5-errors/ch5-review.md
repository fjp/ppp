1. Name four major types of errors and briefly define each one.


2. What kinds of errors can we ignore in student programs?


3. What guarantees should every completed project offer?


4. List three approaches we can take to eliminate errors in programs and produce acceptable software.


5. Why do we hate debugging?


6. What is a syntax error? Give five examples.


7. What is a type error? Give five examples.


8. What is a linker error? Give three examples.


9. What is a logic error? Give three examples.


10. List four potential sources of program errors discussed in the text.


11. How do you know if a result is plausible? What techniques do you have to answer such questions?


12. Compare and contrast having the caller of a function handle a run-time error vs. the called function's handling 
the run-time error.


13. Why is using exceptions a better idea than returning an “error value”?


14. How do you test if an input operation succeeded?


15. Describe the process of how exceptions are thrown and caught.


16. Why, with a vector called v, is v[v.size()] a range error? What would be the result of calling this?


17. Define pre-condition and post-condition; give an example (that is not the area() function from this chapter), 
preferably a computation that requires a loop.


18. When would you not test a pre-condition?


19. When would you not test a post-condition?


20. What are the steps in debugging a program?


21. Why does commenting help when debugging?


22. How does testing differ from debugging?
